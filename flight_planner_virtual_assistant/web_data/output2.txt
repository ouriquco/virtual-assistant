Title: 67 Free Spirit Quotes for Those Who Live Differently - Happier Human
Content: If you have an opinion outside of the norm, people presume you’re argumentative. And if you're driven by happiness rather than money, people insist that you’re just work-shy, and can’t be bothered to chase the big bucks. In fact, if you have any kind of aspirations that move you away from conventional living, people judge and call you crazy. They laugh at your ideas. And seemingly take pride in reminding you of how you should live your life. But not everyone wants to be confined to convention. And it’s those free spirits that make the world a more beautiful place. Table of Contents As children, we’re taught how to behave. Our parents or caregivers teach us how to wait our turn patiently, how to hold our cutlery properly, and to eat our greens because they’ll make us big and strong. They remind us to always say please and thank you; to never interrupt. And to stop asking silly questions. But if we stop asking questions, how can we grow as people? How can we learn to live outside of the four walls we occupy? And explore beyond the horizon. We aren’t robots. We aren’t meant to exist in a clock-in and clock-out world. And yet, so many of us do. So many people forget about the dreams they had. And only worry about tomorrow’s alarm, about having a pair of matching socks to go to work in, and where to grab lunch from on a 45-minute break. But for others, mismatching socks is all part of the fun. It’s part of the journey, like a crazy road trip with spontaneous pitstops for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It’s a journey to find the best sunsets, the best ice cream, and all the other things that make them smile. Those people who are truly living. People who are daring to be different, who continue to ask questions, silly or otherwise. And who unapologetically live their lives in the least robotic manner possible. To those who live differently, the world needs more people like you. It needs more free spirits to break away from the norm. To make their own choices, to follow their own dreams, and to get to the end, feeling that life really was well lived. So let’s celebrate free-spirited living with these free-spirit quotes. And know that adventure is just one pair of mismatched socks away. Being young isn't about age, it's about being a free spirit. You can meet someone of 20 who's boring and old, or you can meet someone of 70 who's youthful and exciting. I met Fred Astaire when he was 72 and I was 21, and I fell in love with him. He certainly was a free spirit.” – Twiggy The free soul is rare but you know it when you see it – basically because you feel good, very good when you are near or with them.” – Charles Bukowski Something about her eyes or voice has always suggested the hint of a free spirit, trapped in a Peck and Peck cage, dreaming of making rude noises at public gatherings of Republicans.” – Jeff Greenfield Let me ensure that throughout life’s journey I do not create my own chains and shackles along the way – but to always freely express myself in all things as I should – and to become all that my true free spirit was destined to be.” ~ Eleesha These free spirit quotes have shown just how diverse and interesting the world can be. They remind us that living differently can open doors to real happiness. And that being a free spirit should be celebrated, rather than judged or sneered at. Living differently may come with its own set of challenges, but that doesn’t mean it should be avoided. It takes real courage to break away from the norm and allow yourself to grow in ways you never dreamed possible. So go be different. Be free. And above all else, be happy.
